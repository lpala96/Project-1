### Overview
Welcome to my plant store, where you will find a very small variety of house plants. When the user first opens the application, they will see the navigation bar that contains the "Pothos" logo and 3 different sections: "Favorites", "Plants", and a basket icon.

If a user initially clicks on the "Favorites" tab, it will have a "Saving For Later" heading title, and the rest of the page will be empty. This section is meant to save plants that the user has liked for the purpose of having a reference list of what they like, or make it easier to add to basket the next time they shop. As the user likes the plants on the plant page, they will begin to be saved in the "Favorites" section, and the section will no longer be empty.

When the user clicks on the "Plants" section, they will see all the available plants in the shop. Each plant card has the name of the respective plant, a heart button used to like the plant, a descritpion of the plant, the price, and at the very bottom a "ADD TO BASKET" button. 

The basket icon, will have a "Basket Items" head title, and like the 'Favotites' section, it will be empty if the user has not added to the basket. When plants are added to the cart, the calculated total of the plants will appear next to "TOTAL". 
Once the user is ready to check out, they can click on the "Check Out" button.

The "Check Out" button will direct the user to the check out section that is currently only availble through the "Check Out" button. Once in the check out section, the user will see two payment options (credit card and Paypal) from which to choose from. The user can then fill in their payment information and click the "Submit" button. Clicking the "Submit" button will trigger a "Payment Received" alert.
